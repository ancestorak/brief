# Overview

Brief is an RSS reader extension for Firefox that attempts to make reading news feeds
(RSS/Atom for now) easy and intuitive. Your feeds should be available when you need them
and just work without forcing you to change every option in the world.

Brief is Free Software licensed under [MPL 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

## Links and resources

Brief is published [on addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brief/).

The official support and feedback channels are:
- [the Brief's channel on Gitter](https://gitter.im/brief-rss/Lobby),
- [the Brief topic on discourse.mozilla.org](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/support-brief/6514),
- issues on the [main repository](https://github.com/brief-rss/brief).

For power users and people who want to contribute there are also:
- [testing versions released on Github](https://github.com/brief-rss/brief/releases),
- [the Brief development channel on Gitter](https://gitter.im/brief-rss/brief),
- issues and pull requests on the [main repository](https://github.com/brief-rss/brief).

If you want to help translate Brief into a language you know,
you can submit translation changes as pull requests manually
or use the [Web Extension Translator](https://lusito.github.io/web-ext-translator/?gh=https://github.com/brief-rss/brief/tree/master)
to help you with the messages file format.
There's a [separate Gitter room](https://gitter.im/brief-rss/localization)
for announcements about localization-related matters (new strings and other matters).
